Kinase-substrate phosphorylation network 

Kinase-substrate phosphorylation interactions (n=5,361) are derived from the databases PhosphositePlus, Phospho.ELM and HPRD (downloaded on 03.02.2015).

The following filtering steps were performed: 
1. Only interactions between human proteins were considered.
2. Only phosphorylation interactions were considered.
3. Protein names were mapped to HGNC gene symbols with g:Profiler. Missing symbols and ambiguous symbols were manually curated. 
4. Interactions of kinase families and substrate proteins were discarded.
