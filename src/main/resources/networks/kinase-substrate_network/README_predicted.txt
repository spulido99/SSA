Predicted phosphorylation network of kinase-substrate interactions

Interactions were predicted using sequence analysis of experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites with binding motifs of 125 kinases. The analysis comprised 11,000 substrate proteins with known phosphorylation sites. For each phosphorylation site and kinase, a Bayesian posterior probability was computed. Probabilities were filtered with a cutoff of p>0.75, resulting in a total of 310,001 interactions. Probability of best site is reported for every protein/kinase pair.
